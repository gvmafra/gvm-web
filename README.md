# gvm-web

This is my personal website. It is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and is hosted on Vercel.
Initially, I will be using Shad.cn & Aceternity UI to build the website. I will also be using the following technologies:

- three.js
- framer-motion
- react-spring
- tabler-icons

I will also be using the following tools:

- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator

It is a work in progress, and I am constantly adding new features and improving the design.
Shoot me an email at gvmafra.contact@gmail.com if you have any suggestions or feedback.
I am looking for a job, so if you are interested in my work, please let me know.

Thank you! -GVM
